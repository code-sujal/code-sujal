# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sujal Sharma

I'm a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at MSRIT. I have a strong passion for tech and software development, especially in front-end and (soon!) backend development. My journey in programming has led me to develop several projects, from interactive websites to e-commerce solutions.

## ðŸš€ Skills and Expertise
- **Frontend Development**: Advanced in HTML and CSS, with intermediate experience in JavaScript.
- **Projects**: I've developed and managed various projects, including *MealMonkey*, a platform to order food on trains, and *Locomotive*, a train ticket booking website.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Currently, I'm mastering frontend development and soon transitioning to backend development to become a full-stack developer. After completing my engineering, I aim to crack the GATE exam to secure a PSU job in my hometown, Korba, where I can support my family.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the community!
